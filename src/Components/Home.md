### Welcome to Shakeri Research Group.
We are part of the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/).
Our multidisciplinary group develops algorithms to analyze data from ***complex stochastic interconnected systems***. We will make use of 
*graph algorithms*, *harmonic geometry*, and *operator theoretic concepts* to advance our understanding of 
- Stochastic spreading processes on networks
- Brain structure and function
- Single cell data analysis and drug discovery
